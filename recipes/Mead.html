    <li>3 lbs honey</li>
    <li>1 gallon of water</li>
    <li>1 packet of wine yeast (or champagne yeast)</li>

  <li>Once the mixture cools down to room temperature, pour it into a sanitized fermenting container.</li>
  <li>Add the yeast and raisins (they help fermentation) and any optional spices for flavor.</li>
  <li>Seal the container with an airlock and let it ferment for 3-4 weeks in a dark, cool place.</li>
